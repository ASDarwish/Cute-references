GOALS:
------

- "Nearly from the start, the system was able to, and did, maintain itself. This
  fact is more important than it might seem. If designers of a system are forced
  to use that system, they quickly become aware of its functional and
  superficial deficiencies and are strongly motivated to correct them before it
  is too late." -- Dennis Richie & Ken Thomson, The UNIX Time-Sharing System

- A self-hosting SMP-safe x86_64 operating system where running on 32-bit x86
  processors is not supported. AMD64 is now the predominant architecture for
  PCs, laptops, and servers

- Learn, by doing, UNIX kernels implementation details ** inside out **

- Deep understanding of today's hardware/software interface, including the
  x86-64 architecture, legacy BIOS, legacy PC hardware, MP/ACPI specs,
  parallelism complexities on modern CPUs (e.g. memory ordering models), etc.

- A mean to explore historical and current operating systems literature on
  topics like memory management, schedulers, filesystems, etc

- A mean to further understand historical and current Unix kernels, including
  SVR2, 4.{2,3}BSD, old and new FreeBSDs and Linux

- First milestone: reach a level of maturity to run basic GNU applications
  including GCC, binutils, and coreutils (in that order)
