# Notes on the Make manual
--------------------------

* Why is specifying PHONY targets important?

  1. Since a phony target has no prerequisits, if a file of the same name
     exists, make will never run the phony target commands.

  2. It's much better in performance since make will not search its implicit
     rules database (which can be big) in case of phony targets
