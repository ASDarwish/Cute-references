+ * don't point to meaningful data yet, which isn't the case. We use
+ * 'SYMBOL[]' since in a declaration, [] just leaves it open to the
+ * number of base type objects which are present, not *where* they are.
+ * SYMBOL[n] just adds more static-time safety; SYMBOL[n][size] lets

+On the use of readelf and similar tools:
+----------------------------------------
+
+Once I removed the identity mappings, kernel was working but exception
+handlers was not working and a division over zero invoked protection faults
+and system restarts.
+
+mm, so how to debug that?
+
+running bochs, we see that after restart, from the registers dump that
+CR2 contains the address CR2=0x0000000000100148, which means somewhere
+we depended on identity mappings are available.
+
+mm, but in the code, we don't use any physical addresses, since all the
+code symbols are already relocated by the script at 0xffffffff80000000+
+addresses.
+
+So, we check what the 0x100148 address might be. The best resource is
+to check the final KERNEL elf.
+
+using readelf kernel.elf we find:
+
+     7: 0000000000100140     0 NOTYPE  LOCAL  DEFAULT    1 gdt
+
+Caught the bastard; we were using the code segment from the gdt (0x08)
+which let to the faulting address be 100148. The code segment was referenced
+by the interrupt handlers, and thus the restarts.
+
+Fine

+The critical manuals used:
+--------------------------
+
+1) AMD64 documents
+2) GCC documentation
+3) GAS documentation  -- MISSING
+4) LD documentation   -- MISSING
+5) GNU make documentation
+5) Undocumented PC - I/O ports and BIOS interrupts
+6) AMD64 System V ABI specification
