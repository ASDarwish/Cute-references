                                 <p>Summary:</p>

<p>The paper presents a faster reimplementation of the traditional file 
system (circa 4.2 BSD) which offers a magnitude order of improvement due
 to flexible allocation policies that allow better locality of reference
 and adapt to peripheral and processor characteristics. Certain features
 like advisory locks, long file names, quotas etc are added.</p>

<p>Problem:</p>

<p>The original 512-byte Unix file system offered very poor performance 
(2% of the disk throughput) due to the small block size, limited 
read-ahead and mostly non-consecutive (essentially random) allocation of
 blocks for files and directories. There was a need for a faster file 
system which could atleast saturate the disk capacity.</p>

<p>Contributions:</p>

<p>Essentially the first working implementation of a file system that 
closed in on the hardware limits by intelligent block allocation 
policies. The authors used specialized knowledge about the hardware to 
improve performance.<br>
The knowledge of the disk geometry was used to guide the design of the 
block allocation policy for both performance and resilience. The 
superblock was replicated across platters and cylinders. <br>
Rotational layout tables were a clever way to allocate blocks so that 
the seek time was closely co-ordinated with processor capacity.<br>
The upper bound on getting all the inodes for a particular cylinder 
group is very attractive and the clever design made it possible. <br>
The increase in block size offered better performance but it was offset 
by the wastage in the small files case. The new idea here was fragments -
 basically variable block sizes. (Fragments present in ext2/ext3).</p>

<p>Flaws:</p>

<p>File system parameterizations are very hardware specific and 
evolution in hardware may prompt design changes. Disks with rotationally
 independent platters etc. They also briefly touch upon DMA which may 
potentially make some of the optimizations useless.</p>

<p>The preallocation of a few blocks at a time is discussed but not 
implemented. Also, the kernel buffers chaining for contiguous reads. 
(The authors point this out).</p>

<p>Performance:</p>

<p>The paper is on the vastly improved performance benefits of this file
 system over the traditional Unix file system. It is amazing that better
 algorithms improved the performance over 10 fold! The users of the time
 would have aggressively shifted to this file system. The contributions 
outlined are the primary reasons for the improved performance. </p>

                                 <p>Paper Review: A Fast File System for UNIX [McKusick, et. al.]</p>

<p><b>Summary:</b></p>

<p>This paper presents the 4.2 BSD UNIX Fast File System, which includes<br>
many improvemnts on its predecessor, the 512-byte block UNIX file system.</p>

<p><b>Problem:</b></p>

<p>The problem was that the "old" file system performed poorly, especially<br>
as the files and directories that resided on it became very fragmented<br>
over time because of the small block size combined with the lack of a<br>
disk-aware layout policy, nor any reserve space set aside for locality<br>
in the face of future allocations.</p>

<p><b>Contributions:</b></p>

<p>* FFS includes a number of performance improvements by locality; it uses<br>
  cylinder groups to keep file metadata (inodes) and data near each<br>
  other.  It also attempts to keep inodes referred to in the same<br>
  directory near to each other.</p>

<p>* By setting aside a percentage (typically something like 5-20%) to<br>
  leave working space for future allocations, FFS maintains better<br>
  locality by reducing file fragmentation.</p>

<p>* FFS' increased block size had a number of benefits: dramatically<br>
  increased read performance on large by making much more of the file's<br>
  content contiguous, increased disk size support, and decreased amount<br>
  of work necessary to find all of a file's blocks.</p>

<p><b>Flaws:</b></p>

<p>* The optimizations are tuned to some characterisitics of hard disks<br>
  at the time, such as multiple platters with multiple arms and heads<br>
  positioned over each other.</p>

<p>* The increased block size is fixed and so big (8KB) that it<br>
  practically necessitated the introduction of a complication: the use<br>
  of "fragments" (block sub-allocations) to keep from wasting too much<br>
  space.</p>

<p><b>Performance Relevance:</b></p>

<p>The FFS improvements are suitable for improving read latencies for many<br>
applications.  Directories and file blocks can both be read at rates<br>
closer to hardware capacity and more predictably over time by not<br>
degrading as much because of fragmentation.  It's primary competitor is<br>
ext2, which lacks only the block sub-allocations, presumably because<br>
ext2's varying initial block size and increased disk size (adn reduced<br>
cost) were a reasonable, simpler alternative, some 8-10 years later.<br>

                                 <p>SUMMARY<br>
"A Fast File System for UNIX" Marshall et al. discuss the implementation
 of the "traditional" UNIX file system, its shortcomings, and how those 
were addressed in Fast FS.</p>

<p><br>
PROBLEM<br>
What features should a file system provide. How to make a file system<br>
efficient.</p>

<p><br>
CONTRIBUTIONS<br>
* Description of the structure of traditional UNIX file system</p>

<p>* Identification of flaws in design and implementation of traditional UNIX FS</p>

<p>* Taking into account hardware specifics for when designing new FS. 
Offsetting cylinder group bookkeeping information to avoid storage on 
one platter is an especially insightful mechanism</p>

<p>* Taking into account typical FS usage in organization. E.g. putting files in the same directory on the same cylinder group</p>

<p>* New features: long file names, file locking, symbolic links that<br>
(potentially) cross volumes, atomic rename, quotas</p>

<p>* Enormous performance improvement</p>

<p><br>
FLAWS<br>
* Some new features, like locking, were not convincingly motivated</p>

<p>* FFS still delivers only 50% of disk bandwidth</p>

<p>* Strives to produce a jack-of-all-trades FS. E.g. argument for improving<br>
traditional FS performance because it doesn't work well for swapping 
doesn't sit well with me. Clearly a dedicated FS would be optimal for 
that (hindsight 20/20)</p>

<p>* FFS seems to alter the user interface, thus its deployment may not be<br>
transparent</p>

<p>* The authors did not seem to identify the "common case". It seems 
that their data of typical FS usage came from a single machine.</p>

<p>* FS parameterization, while a cool idea, may not be that useful in 
practice. It would also be nice if parameter optimization would happen 
automatically.</p>

<p>* I find it very weird that CPU and memory are the bottleneck for disk<br>
transfers.</p>

PERFORMANCE<br>
Storage efficiency, performance overhead, access time, read, write<br>
performance.<br>

                                 <p>Summary:<br>
The paper talks mainly about changes made to the original unix file 
system in 4.2BSD version to improve throughput and reliability. It also 
talk about some features such as file locks, quotas, symbolic links etc 
that were introduced with the new file system.</p>

<p>Problem:<br>
The original unix file system used a single superblock per partition, 
and used 512-bytes disk blocks for allocation. The storage layout used 
is superblock followed by inode area followed by data area. These design
 constraints mean 1) corruption on one superblock destroys the file 
system 2) data read size per transaction is not optimal 3) extreme 
fragmentation could result in inode and data area as files are created 
and deleted, resulting in unnecessory long jumps and hence less 
throughput. New file system was mainly aimed at solving these problems.</p>

<p>Contributions:<br>
- Improved throughput by use of larger block size and intelligent 
storage allocation. Use of global data (including processor speed, 
controller capabilities) to make storage allocation decisions<br>
- Improved reliability by replication of superblock in multiple cylinder
 groups. This improves the chance of recovery in the event of a drive 
failure<br>
- Use of fragments to reduce the impact of wastage of disk space due to bigger block size for smaller files</p>

<p>Flaws:<br>
These may not really be flaws, I may just havent understood them well.<br>
- There hasnt been much of an explantion for choosing 4096 as the block 
size. Paper mentions it allows storing 2^32-byte file with 2 levels of 
indirection. Where did that number come from?<br>
- There hasnt been much explanation about the decision 1 inode per 2048 
bytes. Shouldnt this be based on block size and fragment size?<br>
- 16 times performance improvement over current file system - these 
experiments were done with different bus types. But then it may  be OK, 
because the old file system does not take into account the hardware 
capabilities.<br>
- Book keeping information is stored at varying offsets from the 
beginning of cylinder group and the gap between them is used for data 
storage. Is it guaranteed to be multiple of block size? Or will it be a 
wasted space?</p>

<p>Relevance:<br>
I think the paper describes simple but very efficient ways of improving 
file system throughput and reliability. The fact that most of the 
concepts are still used in file systems 20+ years later says something. 
The only concept that probably is not so relevant today is the use of 
fragments - with the disk space costing nothing, savings provided by 
fragments isnt worth the complications it introduces.<br>

                                 <p><b>Summary</b><br>
The paper presents several improvements to the UNIX filesystem that were
 released with BSD 4.2. These modifications change the implementation 
without changing the underlying abstraction presented to the user. The 
changes are such that the physical properties of disks are taken into 
account when creating files and when laying out the file system on disk.</p>

<p><b>Problem</b><br>
The main problem here is that because of the previous policy of ignoring
 disk performance issues in the filesystem design, the UNIX  filesystem 
was generally only able to provide about 2% of a disk's maximum transfer
 speed to applications.</p>

<p><b>Contributions</b><br>
 * Use of larger block size with performance justification as well as 
the ability to split a block into several fragments when their are 
several smaller files in order to avoid lots of wasted space due to the 
larger block size.<br>
 * Exploiting the physical properties of the disk so that blocks in the 
same file are stored on the same cylinder and are stored in a 
rotationally optimal order in terms of the spacing between blocks.<br>
 * Techniques for both exploiting localization and for spreading out 
unrelated data so that localization continues to be available.</p>

<p><b>Flaws</b><br>
This paper was difficult to have serious problems. Even if they didn't 
fully solve all the problems they took an existing system and provided 
substantial improvements with few drawbacks.</p>

<p><b>Performance and Relevance</b><br>
The performance tests that were performed show substantial justified 
performance. Disk access performance is still a relevant topic today and
 the popularity of "flash-drives" raises questions as to how best to 
exploit newer storage technology.</p>

                                 <p><b>Summary</b><br>
This work presents several extensions to the original UNIX file system 
that improve the overall performance of the system and add a few new 
properties such as symbolic links and long file names. </p>

<p><b>Problems Addressed</b><br>
Using the original file system the disk interface was highly under 
utilized and high throughput was unachievable due to long seek times and
 data fragmentation. The file system also had no knowledge of the 
physical properties of the underlying hardware resulting in mismatches 
between the requested data and the most efficient way of accessing it 
from disk. A major concern of the authors was that of compatibility with
 old software and thus the new extensions had to support all the same 
functionality but with better performance. </p>

<p><b>Contributions</b><br>
To increase the performance of accessing large files the minimum block 
size was increased to 4KB however a mechanism for allowing files to use 
as little as the sector size was also implemented to reduce the amount 
of wasted space in a system with a bunch of small files. To reduce the 
amount of seeking from an i-node to the data, cylinder groups were 
created and the i-nodes for the data contained in the cylinder group 
were also stored within the group. The traditional free block list was 
replaced by a bitmap that eliminated the problem of the free list 
becoming very unordered resulting in many seeks to access a large file. 
To improve sequential performance the cylinder group would also store 
information about how fast the disk spins and would use that information
 to determine how many blocks need to be skipped in order to provide 
fast sequential access. Two physically sequential blocks on disk can not
 always be accessed sequentially because by the time the request arrives
 for the next block the head has already passed over the block and the 
disk must make a full revolution. </p>

<p><b>Flaw</b><br>
Though a performance analysis was done there was not a lot of hard data 
to back up their claims. It would be nice to see a few graphs or charts.
 </p>

<p><b>Performance</b><br>
Throughput for large files and latency for small files seemed to be the 
main aspects of performance the authors were concerned about. These 
objectives were achieved by studying the problems with the original UNIX
 file system and modifying the parts that appeared to have the largest 
bottleneck. <br>

                                 <p><b>Summary</b><br>
This paper is an implementation of a Unix file system that attempts to 
address several well-known flaws of the existing Unix file system. 
(Personally), the paper was particularly interesting due to its thorough
 concern for acting in harmony with available hardware.</p>

<p><b>Problem</b><br>
The "main" problem that this paper addresses was that the existing Unix 
file system could only deliver ~2% of the maximum disk bandwidth. The 
authors attribute this poor performance to three implementation 
problems: there was no real concept of "disk locality," the block size 
(512 bytes) was simply too small, and the free list would eventually 
become randomly ordered.</p>

<p><b>Contributions</b><br>
Cylinder groups are a pretty nice idea. Each cylinder group contains a 
list of the available blocks in a certain number of consecutive 
cylinders. This leads to easy ways to exploit disk locality and limits 
the number of disk seeks while accessing a file. A nice feature of this 
implementation is the way redundant superblock copies are stored. 
Instead of storing everything at the beginning of each cylinder group, 
the superblock/bookkeeping is stored one track further away from the 
previous superblock/bookkeeping information. The data is effectively 
"spiraled" in the disk and makes the loss of any tracks, cylinders, or 
platters not as catastrophic.</p>

<p>The introduction of file fragments. Since it is easy to observe that 
disk throughput increases with block size, the obvious thought is to 
have large blocks. However, most files are quite small, leading to 
increasing amounts of wasted space as the block size increases. 
Fragments attempt to solve this problem by allowing small files to 
occupy portions of a block.</p>

<p>File system parameterization are also a pretty interesting idea. 
Informing the FS of hardware capabilities allows for different 
techniques or algorithms which suit the physical characteristics of a 
disk to be specified. </p>

<p>The idea behind global layout policies is also neat; attempt to 
spread unrelated data into different cylinder groups while attempting to
 localize similar/concurrently accessed data. The authors say that they 
accomplished this by placing inodes for all the files in a directory 
into the same cylinder group. The global layout routines call local 
allocation routines to provide free blocks that try to satisfy as much 
of the global policies as possible.</p>

<p><b>Flaws</b><br>
I'm having a pretty hard time finding flaws in this paper! There is the 
problem that the authors admit to (expanding a file one fragment at a 
time), but other than that, I can't think of anything besides the fact 
that while this FS is a nice improvement, it still doesn't mitigate 
fragmentation. </p>

<p><b>Performance/Relevance</b><br>
The performance numbers pretty much speak for themselves. The new file 
system was able to realize at least twice the reading and writing rates 
of the old file system. CPU utilization shot up, though.</p>

<p>Another nice thing about this file system were the functional 
enhancements. While perhaps along the lines of syntactic sugar, the 
enhancements make the new file system seem as though it's not too 
terribly different from modern Unix and its derivatives.<br>

                                 <p><b>Summary</b><br>
The authors introduce a file system that trades CPU overhead for 
increasing disk transfer rates by improving locality of similar data on 
the disk. A block fragmentation scheme is used to keep the file system 
disk overhead low.</p>

<p><b>Problem</b><br>
The current file system used a free block list, which causes performance
 to decrease after time, because adjacent blocks in the free list are 
not adjacent on disk. </p>

<p><b>Contributions</b><br>
 The major improvement of the article was to increase the spatial 
locality of similar blocks on disk. This was accomplished by introducing
 the idea of a cylinder group. Summary information about the state of 
the cylinder group is kept and when possible cylinder groups are left 
with space to allow files within the cylinder group to grow. Bitmaps 
instead of free lists are used to indicate the free space in a cylinder 
group. The paper discusses the tradeoff of keeping similar objects in 
the same location, but spreading dissimilar objects over the disk. For 
example, inodes of files within a directory are stored in the same 
cylinder group, but new directories are stored in separate cylinder 
groups to allow them to grow.</p>

<p>The paper also introduced the idea of fragmenting a block in order to
 reduce file system internal fragmentation. A file uses as many full 
blocks as possible, but uses a partial block to hold the information 
that did not fit in the full blocks. The cylinder groups� bitmap 
allocation is at the granularity of fragments to allow for allocation. </p>

<p>A number of other improvements were also added to the file system: 
long file names, file locking, symbolic links, easy renames, disk 
quotas.</p>

<p><b>Possible Improvements</b><br>
With the popularity of multi-taking today, it would have been nice to 
see the results of the system if more than one process is contending for
 the disk. The system gets its benefits from locality, but when multiple
 processes are contending for the disk the locality will decrease. It 
would be nice to see how much of the improvements remain in a contention
 situation.</p>

<p>I see increased CPU overhead as a cost of the new file system, 
because now the file system must search bitmaps and compute hashes to 
determine where to write pages as opposed to simply taking the first 
pages from a free list. The articles analysis of CPU simply counts the 
overall utilization. This is not sufficient to capture the overhead, 
because it is expected that utilization CPU increases as disk bandwidth 
increases. The processor spends less time blocked waiting for disk so 
utilization is bound to increase. A more precise analysis of file system
 CPU overhead would help me better understand the costs of the 
improvements.</p>

<p><b>Performance</b><br>
Disk throughput was the major concern of the article. By increasing throughput the system responsiveness is also increased.<br>

                                 <p><b>Summary</b>:<br>
This paper describes a replacement for the traditional Unix file system 
that takes into account the disk access and file creation properties in 
order to get increased performance and recoverability.</p>

<p><b>Problem</b>:<br>
The main problem that they were trying to solve was that the "old file 
system" was very slow. The reason was that it didn't do very intelligent
 allocation; it just put new data in the first block that it knew was 
available. Over time, this led to a very fragmented file system which 
mean lots of seek time. (A secondary goal was to design the system for 
easier recovery, and a third was to introduce a couple new features. For
 instance, I was extremely surprised to find that the existing system --
 built for a time sharing system -- didn't support quotas. To me this 
seems like an incredibly glaring omission.) </p>

<p><b>Contributions</b>:<br>
* FFS became part of many Unixes, and I believe is still the "native" 
file system for Free/Open/NetBSD. Wikipedia says that it was adopted by 
commercial Unixes too.<br>
* Again, it's hard to know which ideas were originally theirs, but it 
would be almost unthinkable to design a new file system without taking 
into consideration properties of the disk and file accesses, how to 
reduce fragmentation, etc. <br>
* Ideas on how to group related data (file + inode in the same cluster group as the directory that file is in)<br>
* The idea to try to keep cluster groups so that they have free space by
 spilling files to other cluster groups while the one they start in are 
still far from full<br>
* Nowadays it would also be rare to design a filesystem that didn't try 
to be recoverable. There's been a lot of development since FFS in this 
area (journaling for instance), but it's clear that they gave this some 
thought with, for instance, the redundant superblock copies that are 
deliberately placed on separate platters or the rename system call<br>
* Implementations of other important features such as long file names and FS locks<br>
* Some other ideas, like having fragments, are still used by some 
filesystems to reduce internal fragmentation. (Even if they don't take 
the same approach, other still, such as NTFS, take other approaches to 
avoid allocating whole blocks for small files.)</p>

<p><b>Flaws</b><br>
* There's still a philosophical question here as to whether the Unix 
bag-of-bytes model for a file is "correct". Even if it isn't though, 
it's still hard to get away from historical issues like this.<br>
* There's also a philosophical question about whether advisory locks are
 the right choice. They claim that they chose them instead of mandatory 
locks because they didn't want to either introduce a new security model 
or provide locks that programs running as the superuser would ignore. 
But if that's their only reason, it's not hard to imagine other 
implementations; for instance when you lock a file specify if it's a 
hard or advisory lock, but just have root ignore the flag that says it's
 a hard lock. Now it's not clear that mandatory locks are actually 
better than advisory locks either, so there could be more here.</p>

<p><b>Performance</b><br>
There were a couple things they were interested in. The main one was 
throughput; this is what their key measurement statistics were. They 
increased bandwidth by two methods. First, they read in larger blocks; 
up to 8KB instead of 1K. Second, they grouped related together in 
physically close areas of the disk platters. This second method also 
leads to another benefit, which is decreased latency for some 
operations. Finally, they were also concerned with the overhead that 
their filesystem imposed on the contents of the disk. They addressed 
this by allocating more than one file to a given block with their 
fragment mechanism.</p>
