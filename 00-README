Specifications, manuals, academic papers used, and notes written while
developing the ‘Cute’ kernel.

Notes:
------

01-ProjectGoals.txt
	- What all of this is about!

CuteNotes.txt
	- Important technical details, bugs, & experiences discovered
	  while developing this project. That's the main “notes” doc.

papers/sched/00-README
	- Study notes for a number of SMP & thread scheduling papers;
	  they form the bases of Cute's scheduler and SMP-safety ops.


Folders:
--------

Some of the folders stated below include their own README files.

Architecture/
	- Old and new specs of Intel and AMD x86(-64) CPUs. Closely related
	  topics like the x86 'memory consistency model' are also included.

Manuals/
	- Official manuals for our development tools (e.g. gcc, and make).
	  These official documents are usually more than enough; dumbed-
	  down resources are disastrous for low-level development.

Notes/
	- Miscellaneous resources and self-written notes

Specs/
	- Specs of the 'hardware/software' interface used by our kernel;
	  examples include timers, interrupt controllers, and BIOS tables.

papers/
	- Historical and relatively new research that was needed while
	  working on this interesting project. Detailed notes I've written
	  while studying these papers are also included.
